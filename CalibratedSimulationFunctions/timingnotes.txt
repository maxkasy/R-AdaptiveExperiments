# notes on timing:
      # for optimal, most time spent in betabinomial
      # for optimalhat, most time in Vfunction
      # the latter scales better for larger V2
      # but both take very long
  
      # time for optimalhandpicked, optimalrandom, betterhalf, Thompson, is negligible
      # conundrum: why is calculation much faster in app?
